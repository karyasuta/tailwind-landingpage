# Build Landing Page by using TailwindCSS

I created the landing page by following a TailwindCSS tutorial series by Dave Gray.

I deployed the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and you can find it here: [TailwindCSS Landing Page](https://tailwind-lp-practice.netlify.app/)

You can find the tutorial here: [TailwindCSS for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6M8znNpim8dRiICRrP5HPft)

[Dave's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DaveGrayTeachesCode) also teaches you lots of other WebDev related topic. Subscribe his channel.

Thanks.
